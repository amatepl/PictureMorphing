# PictureMorphing
This picture morphing algorithm uses the work of Beier and Neely of 1992 :
- To execute the GUI, use matlab and run the main.m.
- Choose two figures and put them inside the main folder.
- Create vectors clicking on the figure (to validate a vector click two times on the vector). Each vectors have a direction
  and an order (Make attention about this, some errors can occur if it's not respected).
- Choose the number of intermediate image and wait some times (the "No issue" message must change to "Morphing finished").
- When the morphing is finished you can push to the play button, an animation will occur to present the morphing. 
- The different images can be found inside the fig folder.
- (Some examples are inside "Images To Test" folder). 
Good Morphing !
